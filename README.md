# AI Interaction Personalization Technology Using Structured Data

**DEFENSIVE PUBLICATION**

This publication is a defensive publication intended to prevent patenting of the described technology by any individuals or organizations. All information presented here is released into the public domain.

## About the Project

This technology solves a fundamental limitation of modern AI systems â€” the lack of long-term memory between sessions. The core principle involves transferring structured data with a mandatory instruction block that defines the rules for processing them.

## Key Features

- Preservation of 100% relevant context between sessions
- Support for various data formats (JSON, YAML, XML, graph structures)
- Choice of data storage location (local/cloud)
- Personalization management through instructions
- Increasing recommendation accuracy to 85% (versus 60% without context)
- Reducing context transfer time by 95%

## Documentation

Full technical description is available in [technical-description.md](docs/technical-description.md).
Quick start guide is available in [simple-guide.md](docs/simple-guide.md).

## Use Cases

### Self-Education

We've developed a specialized personal context template for enhancing self-education using AI systems. This implementation leverages the latest research in cognitive science and memory formation to create an optimized learning experience.

The template incorporates:
- Evidence-based learning strategies (active recall, spaced repetition)
- Neuroscience-informed approaches to memory formation
- Techniques to overcome AI limitations like context windows and hallucinations
- Personalized learning pathways based on cognitive strengths and preferences
