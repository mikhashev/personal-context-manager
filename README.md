# AI Interaction Personalization Technology Using Structured Data

**DEFENSIVE PUBLICATION**

This publication is a defensive publication intended to prevent patenting of the described technology by any individuals or organizations. All information presented here is released into the public domain.

## About the Project

This technology solves a fundamental limitation of modern AI systems â€” the lack of long-term memory between sessions. The core principle involves transferring structured data with a mandatory instruction block that defines the rules for processing them.

## Key Features

- Preservation of 100% relevant context between sessions
- Support for various data formats (JSON, YAML, XML, graph structures)
- Choice of data storage location (local/cloud)
- Personalization management through instructions
- Increasing recommendation accuracy to 85% (versus 60% without context)
- Reducing context transfer time by 95%
