## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Understanding of structured data formats (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of AI systems and their interaction methods

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/personal-context-manager.git
   cd personal-context-manager
   ```
3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mikhashev/personal-context-manager.git
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Discuss before coding**: For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss your approach and ensure your work aligns with the project's direction.

2. **Create a branch**: Create a branch from `main` for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Keep changes focused**: Each pull request should address a single concern. If you have multiple unrelated changes, submit separate pull requests.

4. **Follow existing style**: Maintain consistency with the existing codebase and documentation style.

5. **Document your changes**: Update documentation to reflect your changes. For code, include comments as needed.

6. **Test thoroughly**: Test your changes with multiple AI systems if possible to ensure compatibility.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork**: Before submitting, merge any changes from the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a pull request**: Go to GitHub and create a pull request from your branch to the main repository.

4. **Describe your changes**: In the pull request, provide:
   - A concise description of what your changes do
   - Why these changes are valuable
   - Any testing you've performed
   - References to relevant issues

5. **Review process**: Maintainers will review your PR, possibly requesting changes. Be responsive to feedback.

6. **Merge**: Once approved, a maintainer will merge your pull request.

## Ethical Considerations

When contributing to this project, please consider the ethical implications of your contributions:

1. **Respect privacy**: Context examples should use synthetic data, not real personal information.

2. **Consider inclusivity**: Ensure your contributions work for diverse users with different abilities, backgrounds, and resources.

3. **Prevent misuse**: Design features with safeguards against potential abuse.

4. **Transparency**: Any data processing or storage mechanisms should be transparent and understandable to users.

5. **Prohibited applications**: Do not contribute features specifically designed for military use, surveillance, or manipulative purposes.

## Documentation Guidelines

Documentation is crucial for this project. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Clear language**: Use simple, clear language. Avoid jargon when possible.

2. **Examples**: Include practical examples that demonstrate real-world applications.

3. **Step-by-step instructions**: For implementation guides, provide clear step-by-step instructions.

4. **Formatting**: Use Markdown formatting consistently:
   - `#` for main headers
   - `##` for section headers
   - `` ` `` for inline code
   - ` ``` ` for code blocks with language specified

5. **Images**: Include diagrams or screenshots when they help clarify complex concepts.

## Community and Communication

### Discussions and Questions

- Use GitHub Discussions for general questions and ideas
- Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests

### Decision Making Process

This project uses a consensus-seeking process:

1. Proposals are made through issues or pull requests
2. Community members provide feedback and suggestions
3. Maintainers work to find consensus among contributors
4. In cases where consensus cannot be reached, maintainers make the final decision

### Recognition

All contributors will be recognized in our [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file. We value all forms of contributions equally!
