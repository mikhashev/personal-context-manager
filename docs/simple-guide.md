# Getting Started with AI Context Technology

Here's a simple guide to help you start using the Personal Context Technology with your favorite AI assistant:

## Step 1: Create Your Basic Context File

Copy this basic template to get started quickly:

```json
{
  "basic_info": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "timezone": "Your Timezone",
    "occupation": "Your Job/Role"
  },
  "preferences": {
    "communication_style": "detailed/concise/visual",
    "interests": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
    "learning_goals": ["goal1", "goal2"]
  },
  "instruction": {
    "primary": "Use this information to personalize your responses to me",
    "context_update": "If you learn important new information about me, suggest additions to this context",
    "privacy": "Do not share this information with others"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "created": "2025-03-18"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Customize Your Context

1. Replace the placeholders with your actual information
2. Add or remove sections based on your needs
3. Customize the instructions to specify how you want the AI to use your data

## Step 3: Save Your Context

1. Save this file somewhere on your device (e.g., `my_context.json`)
2. For privacy, consider password-protecting the file or storing it in a secure location

## Step 4: Use Your Context with AI

### Method 1: Direct Paste
1. Copy the entire JSON content
2. Start a new chat with your AI assistant
3. Paste the context at the beginning of your conversation
4. Say something like: "Please use this context for our conversation"

### Method 2: File Upload (if supported)
1. Upload your context file to the AI assistant
2. Ask the AI to read and use the file as your personal context

## Step 5: Test Your Context

Try asking a few questions that should be influenced by your context:
- "What topics should I focus on next?"
- "Can you recommend something based on my interests?"
- "How would you summarize what you know about me?"

## Step 6: Update Your Context

1. When your information changes, update the appropriate section in your file
2. Increment the version number in the metadata
3. In your next conversation, provide the updated context

## Example Use Case: Productivity Assistant

```json
{
  "basic_info": {
    "name": "Alex",
    "role": "Project Manager"
  },
  "productivity": {
    "work_hours": "9:00-17:00",
    "focus_times": ["10:00-12:00", "15:00-16:30"],
    "current_projects": [
      {
        "name": "Website Redesign",
        "deadline": "2025-04-15",
        "priority": "high"
      },
      {
        "name": "Client Proposal",
        "deadline": "2025-03-25",
        "priority": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "tools": ["Trello", "Slack", "Figma"]
  },
  "instruction": {
    "primary": "Help me manage my tasks and projects efficiently",
    "suggestions": "Provide time management advice based on my work hours and focus times",
    "priorities": "Remind me of urgent deadlines when relevant"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.1",
    "last_updated": "2025-03-18"
  }
}
```

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic information and expand gradually
2. **Be specific in instructions**: The AI will follow exactly what you specify
3. **Regular updates**: Keep your context current for better results
4. **Different contexts for different purposes**: Consider creating separate contexts for work, education, etc.
5. **Privacy first**: Only include information you're comfortable sharing

## Troubleshooting

- **AI not recognizing the context**: Ensure your JSON is properly formatted without syntax errors
- **Too much information**: If the AI seems overwhelmed, simplify your context
- **Instructions not followed**: Make your instructions more explicit and place them at the beginning

That's it! You're ready to start using personalized AI interactions with your own controlled context.
