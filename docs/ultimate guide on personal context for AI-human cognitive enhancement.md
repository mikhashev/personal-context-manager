## Introduction

In the era of artificial intelligence, unprecedented opportunities for enhancing human cognitive abilities are opening up before us. However, there is a fundamental paradox: when used incorrectly, these same technologies can lead to the atrophy of our cognitive skills.

This guide presents a comprehensive approach to using personal context as a tool for enhancing human intelligence when interacting with AI. Personal context is not just a way to personalize interaction with AI, but a structured method of transforming AI from a potentially substituting tool into a cognitive enhancer of human abilities.

### What is Personal Context?

Personal context is a structured set of data along with instructions that you provide to artificial intelligence to customize the interaction. It includes:

1. **Information about you**: your goals, preferences, cognitive profile, knowledge, and skills.
2. **Instructions for AI**: how to interpret and use this information.
3. **Metadata**: information about the context itself, history of changes.

The key difference in the approach presented in this guide is that personal context here is oriented not simply toward personalization, but toward **strategic enhancement of human cognitive abilities**.

### The Problem of Delegating Cognitive Functions

When interacting with AI, people tend to delegate cognitive functions, which can lead to:

- Decreased ability to memorize information
- Loss of critical thinking skills
- Reduced creative abilities
- Weakened analytical skills
- Diminished ability to concentrate deeply

This guide presents an approach to designing personal context that prevents these negative consequences, transforming interaction with AI into a process that **enhances** your cognitive abilities.

## Fundamental Principles of Intelligence Enhancement

### Principle 1: Conscious Delegation

**Foundation**: Delegate cognitive tasks to AI only after conscious decision and understanding of the consequences.

**Implementation in Personal Context**:
- Creating a "Delegation Rules" section with clear criteria for different types of tasks
- Documenting delegated tasks for periodic audit
- Configuring AI to request confirmation before performing new types of tasks

### Principle 2: Cognitive Partnership

**Foundation**: Perceive AI as a tool for enhancing, not replacing, your intelligence.

**Implementation in Personal Context**:
- Setting up a "co-thinking" mode instead of receiving ready-made answers
- Structuring interaction as a dialogue rather than one-sided requests
- Instructions for AI to stimulate your own thinking

### Principle 3: Active Thinking

**Foundation**: Think independently first, then turn to AI to verify and expand your thinking.

**Implementation in Personal Context**:
- "First self, then AI" protocol for different types of tasks
- Instructions for AI to request your preliminary opinion
- Mechanisms for comparing your thinking and AI suggestions

### Principle 4: Metacognitive Monitoring

**Foundation**: Regularly evaluate the impact of interaction with AI on your cognitive abilities.

**Implementation in Personal Context**:
- Integrated mechanisms for tracking progress of cognitive skills
- Periodic surveys for self-assessment of changes in thinking abilities
- AI interaction journal with metrics on the impact on cognitive skills

### Principle 5: Evolutionary Correspondence

**Foundation**: Adapt the use of AI considering the evolutionary features of the human mind.

**Implementation in Personal Context**:
- Integration of understanding about evolutionary cognitive predispositions
- Adaptation of interaction to your unique cognitive strengths
- Support for natural learning and memorization processes

## Instructions for AI in Personal Context

The instruction section in personal context is key to ensuring cognitive enhancement rather than replacement. Below are detailed recommendations for composing effective instructions.

### Basic Principles of Instructions for Cognitive Enhancement

1. **Process Priority Over Result**
   - Instruct AI to focus on the thinking process, not just getting the right answer
   - Request demonstration of reasoning
   - Ask for explanation of intermediate steps

2. **Socratic Approach**
   - Direct AI to use questions instead of direct statements
   - Stimulate your own thinking through guiding questions
   - Create a dialogic structure of interaction

3. **Cognitive Scaffolding**
   - Instruct AI to provide an optimal level of support
   - Request gradual reduction of support as skills develop
   - Demand adaptive assistance depending on task complexity

4. **Thinking Transparency**
   - Require AI to explain its own reasoning
   - Ask to indicate limitations and uncertainties in analysis
   - Request explicit designation of assumptions

5. **Multi-perspective Approach**
   - Instruct AI to offer multiple viewpoints
   - Request analysis of problems from different positions
   - Demand consideration of opposing arguments

## Practical Application of Personal Context

### Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

1. **Creating a Basic Context**
   - Start with a minimal version including basic information and instructions
   - Focus on one cognitive skill to begin with
   - Use the suggested templates, adapting them to your needs

2. **Testing and Adaptation**
   - Conduct several sessions with AI using the created context
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of interaction for developing the chosen skill
   - Make adjustments to instructions and context structure

3. **Expansion and Deepening**
   - Gradually add sections for other cognitive skills
   - Detail your profile and development strategies
   - Refine instructions based on accumulated experience

4. **Integration of Metacognitive Monitoring**
   - Add mechanisms for tracking progress
   - Implement regular reflective sessions
   - Configure the system to collect data on your cognitive development

5. **Systematic Application**
   - Use the context regularly for various cognitive tasks
   - Follow structured skill development protocols
   - Periodically update the context, reflecting your progress

### Storage and Transfer Formats

#### JSON Format
JSON is the most common format for personal context due to its structure and wide support:

```json
{
  "basic_info": { ... },
  "cognitive_profile": { ... },
  "cognitive_enhancement_strategies": { ... },
  "instruction": { ... },
  "metadata": { ... }
}
```

#### YAML Format
YAML offers a more readable alternative, especially for large contexts:

```yaml
basic_info:
  name: Your name
  cognitive_goals:
    - Developing critical thinking
    - Enhancing analytical abilities
  learning_style: visual

cognitive_profile:
  thinking_styles:
    analytical: high
    creative: medium
  memory_patterns:
    strengths:
      - visual memory
      - conceptual understanding
```

#### Modular Approach
For complex contexts, a modular organization with separation into individual files is recommended:

```
personal_context/
  ├── basic_info.json
  ├── cognitive_profile.json
  ├── critical_thinking/
  │   ├── profile.json
  │   ├── strategies.json
  │   └── progress.json
  ├── creative_thinking/
  │   ├── profile.json
  │   └── strategies.json
  ├── instructions.json
  └── metadata.json
```

### Methods of Transmitting Context to AI

1. **Direct Insertion**
   - Copying and pasting the context at the beginning of a dialogue
   - Advantages: simplicity, universality
   - Disadvantages: need to repeat with each new session

2. **File Upload**
   - If the AI platform supports file uploads
   - Advantages: convenience, ability to use large contexts
   - Disadvantages: not supported by all platforms

3. **Repository Link**
   - Storage in an online repository with providing AI a link
   - Advantages: centralized updating, no need for re-uploading
   - Disadvantages: requires AI access to external resources

4. **API Integration**
   - For advanced users, using API to transmit context
   - Advantages: automation, possibility of programmatic management
   - Disadvantages: technical complexity, requires development

### Cognitive Interaction Protocols

#### Critical Thinking Development Protocol

1. **Preparation**
   - Choose a topic or argument for analysis
   - Configure personal context with a focus on critical thinking
   - Set a specific session goal (e.g., identifying assumptions)

2. **Initial Analysis**
   - Conduct independent analysis, without AI help
   - Record your conclusions, arguments, and questions
   - Identify areas of uncertainty or difficulty

3. **Interaction with AI**

   - Note changes in your thinking as a result of the dialogue
   - Reflect progress in the metacognitive monitoring section

#### Creative Thinking Development Protocol

1. **Preparation**
   - Define a creative task or problem
   - Configure personal context with a focus on creative thinking
   - Set a specific session goal (e.g., generating alternatives)

2. **Independent Generation**
   - Conduct limited brainstorming without AI help
   - Record all your ideas, without censorship or criticism
   - Identify areas where you experience creative blocks

3. **Interaction with AI**
   - Provide AI with your ideas and request appropriate support
   - Work with suggested creativity techniques
   - Use AI ideas as a stimulus for your own creative thought

4. **Combination and Development**
   - Create new ideas by combining yours and those suggested by AI
   - Develop the most promising concepts

### Step-by-Step Metacognitive Reflection Protocol

For systematic evaluation of AI interaction impact on cognitive abilities, it's recommended to regularly conduct metacognitive reflection:

1. **Skill Status Assessment**
   - What can I do better/worse without AI help compared to the previous period?
   - Which skills have developed, and which have atrophied?
   - How has the speed and quality of my independent thinking changed?

2. **Interaction Pattern Analysis**
   - For which tasks do I automatically turn to AI?
   - Which cognitive tasks do I try to solve independently?
   - What is my typical level of involvement when working with AI?

3. **Balance Assessment**
   - How optimal is the current distribution of cognitive functions between me and AI?
   - Where am I delegating too much, and where not enough?
   - What changes in task distribution are necessary?

4. **Development Planning**
   - Which cognitive skills require targeted development?
   - What changes in instructions for AI are necessary?
   - Which exercises will help strengthen weakened skills?

### Optimal Periodicity of Metacognitive Monitoring

The following periodicity of metacognitive practices is recommended:

### Integration of Metacognitive Monitoring into Daily Activities

For effective integration of metacognitive practices into everyday life, it is recommended to:

1. **Establish Triggers for Reflection**
   - Completion of a session with AI
   - End of the workday
   - Beginning and end of the week
   - Discovery of difficulties in independently solving tasks

2. **Use Structured Tools**
   - Templates for quick reflection
   - Progress tracking systems
   - Automatic reminders
   - Visual progress indicators

3. **Maintain a Metacognitive Journal**
   - Recording significant observations
   - Documenting changes in cognitive abilities
   - Tracking effective and ineffective strategies
   - Planning changes in approach to interaction with AI

   - Creating a catalog of typical implicit assumptions
   - Investigating the influence of assumptions on conclusions

3. **Evidence Evaluation**
   - Developing criteria for evaluating evidence quality
   - Practicing applying these criteria to different types of sources
   - Analyzing one's own tendency to accept certain types of evidence

### Metacognitive Practices for Memory

1. **Self-testing**
   - Regular testing of ability to reproduce information without AI help
   - Documenting types of information that are easier/harder to remember
   - Experiments with various memorization techniques for different types of information

2. **Recall Strategy Analysis**
   - Observing your own strategies for searching information in memory

## Conclusion

Personal context represents a powerful tool for enhancing human intelligence when interacting with AI. Properly structured and used, it allows transforming artificial intelligence from a potential source of cognitive atrophy into a catalyst for intellectual growth.

Key conclusions of this guide:

1. **Conscious Delegation**: Personal context helps structure the delegation of cognitive functions, maintaining control over what and how you transfer to AI.

2. **Cognitive Partnership**: Using personal context creates a foundation for partnership relations with AI, where technology complements rather than replaces your cognitive abilities.

3. **Metacognitive Development**: The process of creating and maintaining personal context is itself a powerful tool for developing metacognitive skills.

4. **Adaptive Interaction**: Personal context allows adapting interaction with AI to your unique cognitive characteristics, goals, and preferences.

5. **Ethical Awareness**: A structured approach to AI interaction through personal context promotes ethically conscious use of technology.

In the era of rapid artificial intelligence development, the evolution of human cognitive abilities depends not so much on the technologies themselves, but on how we interact with them. Personal context is not just a tool for improving AI work, but a method for consciously directing our own cognitive development in the era of algorithmic intelligence.
