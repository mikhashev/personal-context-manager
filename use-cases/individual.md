# Individual Use Cases for Personal Context Technology

This document demonstrates how individuals can implement personal context technology for various aspects of life management, productivity, and personal growth.

## Personal Knowledge Management

### Use Case: Building a Personal Knowledge Base

Context structure for managing personal knowledge, notes, and learnings:

      "key_concepts": ["Neural Networks", "Decision Trees", "Reinforcement Learning"],
      "learning_resources": [
        {"title": "Machine Learning Course", "platform": "Coursera", "completion": "85%"},
        {"title": "Hands-On Machine Learning", "author": "Aurélien Géron", "notes": "Currently on Chapter 7"}
      ],
      "projects": [
        {"name": "Image classifier", "status": "completed", "github": "github.com/taylor/image-classifier"}
      ]
    },
    {

      "proficiency": "beginner",
      "key_concepts": ["Memory Formation", "Cognitive Biases", "Learning Techniques"],
      "learning_resources": [
        {"title": "Thinking, Fast and Slow", "author": "Daniel Kahneman", "notes": "Completed, detailed notes in Notion"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "note_taking_system": {
    "primary_tool": "Obsidian",
    "structure": "Zettelkasten method",
    "current_projects": [
      {"topic": "Intersection of ML and psychology", "status": "researching"}
    ]
  },
  "instruction": {
    "primary": "Help me organize, retrieve, and expand my knowledge base",
    "context_update": "Suggest adding new concepts, resources, or connections between knowledge areas",
    "learning_preferences": "I prefer visual explanations and practical examples",

#### Implementation Notes:
- Weekly updates to social calendar
- Monthly review of relationship maintenance
- Very sensitive information - consider encryption or omission of certain details
- Focus on information useful for maintaining relationships, not personal details about others without their consent

Each of these use cases demonstrates how the personal context technology can be adapted for different individual needs, while maintaining the core structure of data + instructions. Users can implement as many or as few of these contexts as relevant to their needs.
