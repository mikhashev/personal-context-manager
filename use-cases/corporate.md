## Multi-level Access Control

One of the most powerful features for corporate implementations is the ability to implement granular access control:

```yaml
# team_context.yaml
instruction:
  primary: "Use this context for answers about team projects"
  access_control:
    # HR can see basic employee info but not technical details
    hr_level: [
      "team_members.*.name", 
      "team_members.*.position", 
      "team_members.*.start_date"
    ]
    
    # Team members can see projects they're assigned to
    team_member_level: [
      "basic_info", 
      "team_members", 
      "projects.*.deadline", 
      "projects.*.status",
      "projects.*.tasks"
    ]
    
    # Team leads can see all project data including notes
    team_lead_level: [
      "projects.*.notes", 
      "projects.*.budget", 
      "projects.*.client_feedback"
    ]
    
    # Executives can see strategic information
    executive_level: [
      "strategic_plans", 
      "financial_projections", 
      "risk_assessments"
    ]
```

This allows different employees to interact with the same core context while automatically filtering information based on their role and clearance level.

## Integration with Enterprise Systems

### CRM Integration
```javascript
// Example code for CRM integration
async function enrichContextWithCRMData(context, employeeId) {
  // Get employee's client assignments
  const clientAssignments = await CRM.getClientAssignmentsByEmployee(employeeId);
  
  // Get recent interactions
  const recentInteractions = await CRM.getRecentInteractions(
    clientAssignments.map(a => a.clientId),
    { days: 30 }
  );
  
  // Enrich context with CRM data
  context.client_relationships = clientAssignments.map(assignment => ({
    client_name: assignment.clientName,
    relationship_stage: assignment.stage,
    account_value: assignment.value,
    last_interaction: recentInteractions.find(i => i.clientId === assignment.clientId)
  }));
  
  return context;
}
```

### HR System Integration
```javascript
// Example code for HR integration
async function enrichContextWithHRData(context, departmentId) {
  // Get department organization structure
  const orgStructure = await HR.getDepartmentStructure(departmentId);
  
  // Get training records for department members
  const trainingRecords = await HR.getTeamTrainingRecords(departmentId);
  
  // Add to context
  context.organization = {
    structure: orgStructure,
    reporting_lines: orgStructure.reportingLines,
    key_competencies: trainingRecords.aggregateCompetencies()
  };
  
  return context;
}
```

## Enterprise Context Templates

### Executive Context Template
```json
{
  "basic_info": {
    "name": "${employee.name}",
    "position": "${employee.title}",
    "department": "${employee.department}",
    "direct_reports": "${hr.directReports}"
  },
  "strategic_focus": {
    "company_objectives": "${strategy.currentObjectives}",
    "department_goals": "${department.currentGoals}",
    "key_initiatives": "${employee.assignedInitiatives}"
  },
  "performance_metrics": {
    "department_kpis": "${department.kpis}",
    "budget_status": "${finance.budgetStatus}",
    "team_productivity": "${analytics.teamProductivity}"
  },
  "meeting_schedule": "${calendar.upcomingMeetings}",
  "decision_log": "${decisions.recentDecisions}",
  "instruction": {
    "primary": "Assist with strategic planning and executive decision making",
    "focus_areas": "Prioritize ${strategy.currentPriorities}",
    "update_cadence": "Update metrics weekly, objectives quarterly",
    "required_perspective": "Balance short-term performance with long-term strategy"
  }
}
```

### Project Manager Context Template

  "basic_info": {
    "name": "${employee.name}",
    "position": "Project Manager",
    "department": "${employee.department}"
  },
  "active_projects": "${projects.active}",
  "team_resources": {
    "team_members": "${projects.teamMembers}",
    "skill_matrix": "${hr.teamSkills}",
    "availability": "${resource.availability}"
  },
  "schedules": {
    "milestones": "${projects.milestones}",
    "critical_path": "${projects.criticalPath}",
    "dependencies": "${projects.dependencies}"
  },
  "budget_tracking": "${finance.projectBudgets}",
  "risk_register": "${risks.active}",
  "instruction": {
    "primary": "Support project planning, resource allocation, and risk management",
    "update_guidance": "Update project status daily, risks weekly",
    "recommendations": "Prioritize recommendations that keep projects on schedule and budget"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Classification
Implement context data classification that aligns with your existing information security policies:

| Classification | Description | Storage Requirements | Example Context Elements |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Public | Information that can be freely shared | Standard protection | Basic company information, public product details |
| Internal | For employees only | Access control required | Organizational structure, general strategy, team composition |
| Confidential | Limited to specific teams | Encryption + access control | Project details, client information, financial data |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive | Strong encryption + strict access | Strategic plans, proprietary research, personal data |

### Authentication and Authorization
- Implement SSO integration for context access
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for context permissions
- Consider multi-factor authentication for sensitive contexts
- Implement API keys with limited scopes for system integrations

### Audit and Compliance
For regulated industries, implement:
- Complete audit trails of context access and modifications
- Regular compliance reviews of shared contexts
- Data retention policies aligned with regulatory requirements
- Automated scanning for sensitive information in contexts
