# How to Use Your Adaptive Engineering Context File

This README provides step-by-step instructions for using your adaptive engineering context file to enhance AI interactions across various engineering disciplines.

## What is the Adaptive Engineering Context File?

The adaptive engineering context file is a structured JSON document that:

- Automatically adapts to your specific engineering discipline
- Helps AI systems understand your background, skills, and experience
- Provides information about your current projects and technical challenges
- Maps your cognitive strengths and preferred learning strategies
- Documents your development environment and technical constraints
- Includes mental models and frameworks for analyzing engineering problems
- Features transparency controls to show how your context influences responses

The file is designed to make AI interactions more personalized, relevant, and effective for engineering work across multiple disciplines including software, mechanical, electrical, civil, aerospace, chemical, biomedical, environmental, industrial, and systems engineering.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Personalize Your Context File

- Open the [adaptive_engineering_context_template.json](adaptive_engineering_context_template.json) file in any text editor
- Replace all placeholders in [brackets] with your specific information
- At minimum, fill out:
  - Your name and engineering discipline
  - Experience level and primary role
  - Current project information
  - Key tools and technologies you use
- For the richest experience, complete as many sections as possible

### 2. Share with AI at the Start of Sessions

```
Hello! I'd like to share my adaptive engineering context file to help you provide more personalized support for my engineering work.

[Paste the entire JSON file here or attach as file]

Please confirm you've received this context and will use it to guide our session.
```

### 3. Use Transparency Features to Understand Context Usage

The context file includes transparency features that provide visibility into how the AI is using your information:

- **Pre-Response Disclosure**: Before answering, the AI shows which parts of your context it plans to use
- **Inline Citations**: References to your context data are clearly marked in responses with `[PC: path.to.data]`
- **Post-Response Verification**: After responding, the AI can verify which context elements were actually used
- **Configurable Transparency Levels**:
  - Full: All transparency features (pre-disclosure, citations, post-verification)
  - Standard: Pre-disclosure and citations (default)
  - Minimal: Only citations
  
You can adjust the transparency level by modifying the `ai_rules.instruction.transparency.activation_levels.current_setting` value in your context file.

### 4. Let AI Detect Your Engineering Discipline

The context file includes a comprehensive database of terminology, tools, and challenges for 10 different engineering disciplines. The AI will:

- Automatically detect your discipline from your questions and context file
- Adapt its responses to use appropriate terminology and concepts
- Focus on challenges relevant to your specific field
- Track the detected discipline in the metadata section

If you work across multiple disciplines, the AI will adjust based on the specific questions you ask.

### 4. Ask Engineering Questions That Leverage Your Context

After sharing the context, you can ask questions like:

- "Given my current project constraints, how should I implement [specific feature]?"
- "Based on my experience level with [technology], what approach would you recommend for [problem]?"
- "Considering my learning style, what's the best way to master [technical skill]?"
- "Using systems thinking from the mental models section, help me analyze my current design."
- "Given my career goals, what skills should I prioritize developing next?"

### 5. Use Discipline-Specific Prompts

The context file includes specialized prompts for each engineering discipline:

- **Software Engineering**: "How would you refactor this code to improve maintainability?"
- **Mechanical Engineering**: "What material would be best suited for this high-temperature application?"
- **Electrical Engineering**: "What approach would minimize interference in this sensor circuit?"
- **Civil Engineering**: "What structural system would be most appropriate for this high-rise building?"
- **Aerospace Engineering**: "How can I optimize this component for weight while maintaining safety margins?"
- **Chemical Engineering**: "What reactor design would optimize yield for this reaction?"
- **Biomedical Engineering**: "What materials would be most biocompatible for this implantable device?"
- **Environmental Engineering**: "What treatment process would be most effective for this contaminant?"
- **Industrial Engineering**: "How can I optimize this production line for throughput?"
- **Systems Engineering**: "How should I structure requirements for this complex system?"

### 6. Apply Mental Models to Engineering Problems

The context file includes mental models that can help analyze problems more effectively:

- Request analysis using specific models: "Use first principles thinking to help me redesign this component."
- Ask for multi-model perspectives: "Analyze this scaling issue using both systems thinking and probabilistic reasoning."
- Apply domain-crossing insights: "How might psychological frameworks help improve the user experience of this technical system?"

### 7. Update Your Context File Regularly

Keep your context file current by updating:

- **Current Projects**: Update progress, blockers, and current tasks
- **Technical Environment**: Add new tools, technologies, or equipment you're using
- **Learning Progress**: Document newly acquired skills and insights
- **Skill Inventory**: Revise proficiency levels as you improve
- **Certifications**: Add new professional certifications or qualifications

A good practice is to review and update your context file:
- At the start of new projects
- After learning significant new skills
- When changing roles or responsibilities
- When your technical environment changes substantially

## Tips for Maximizing Value

1. **Be Specific**: The more detail you provide in your context file, the more personalized the AI's responses can be.

2. **Prioritize Updates**: Focus on keeping current projects and technical challenges up-to-date.

3. **Reference Mental Models**: Explicitly ask the AI to apply specific mental models from your context file.

4. **Use Field-Specific Terminology**: Incorporate terminology from your discipline to help the AI better adapt.

5. **Leverage Transparency Features**: Review the context usage information to see which parts of your context are most valuable and which might need enhancement.

6. **Track Discipline Detection**: The metadata section includes fields that track which discipline has been detected and with what confidence level.

7. **Cross-Disciplinary Work**: If you work across multiple disciplines, the AI will adjust based on the specific questions you ask.

8. **Integration with Development Workflow**: Consider updating your context file as part of your regular development process.

## Looking Ahead: Auto-Completion and Future Improvements
