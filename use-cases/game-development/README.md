# Simple Guide: Using Your Game Development Context File

Here's a straightforward guide on how to use your [personal context file](https://github.com/mikhashev/personal-context-manager/blob/main/use-cases/game-development/game_development_context_template.json) for game development tasks:

## Step 1: Set Up Your Context File (If you need more accurate answers)

1. Open the JSON template or go to Step 2
2. Replace all [placeholders] with your specific information. Tip: You can AI to ask you qurstions to fill your specific information.
3. Pay special attention to:
   - Your experience level and primary role
   - Current projects and technical environment
   - Learning style and cognitive preferences
   - Specific game development skills and goals

## Step 2: Share With AI at the Start of Development Sessions

```
Hello! I'd like to share my personal context file to help you provide more personalized game development support.
[Paste the entire JSON file here or attach it]
Please confirm you've received this context and will use it to guide our game development session.
```

## Step 3: Ask Game Development Questions

After sharing the context, you can ask questions like:

- "How should I implement [game mechanic] in my current project using [game engine]?"
- "I'm struggling with [specific challenge] in my game. Based on my experience level, what approach would you recommend?"
- "Can you analyze this game system design using the mental models in my context file?"
- "What would be the next step in my learning journey for mastering [skill]?"
- "Help me debug this code from my current project with the context of my programming experience."

## Step 4: Update Your Context File Regularly

- After completing significant milestones or learning new skills
- When starting new game projects
- When identifying new challenges or insights
- When your development goals or focus changes

## Step 5: Key Sections to Update Frequently

- **Current Projects**: Update progress, blockers, and current tasks
- **Learning Progress**: Add newly mastered skills and insights
- **Knowledge Connections**: Document how different game development areas connect
- **AI Integration**: Refine prompts based on which ones work best for you

## Making the Most of Mental Models in Your Context

The mental models included in your context file (systems thinking, game theory, etc.) help AI provide more holistic analysis of your game development questions. When facing complex challenges, try:

- "Analyze my procedural generation system using systems thinking principles"
- "Help me apply probabilistic thinking to my game's loot system"
- "Use second-order thinking to evaluate potential player responses to this mechanic"

Remember that your context file is both a tool for AI and a framework for your own development journey. By maintaining it thoughtfully, you'll create a valuable record of your progress and insights as a game developer. Feel free to experimenting and modify context file as you like.
