# Understanding Our World: A Learning Roadmap

## Introduction

This roadmap is designed for Mike, a 35-year-old male seeking to develop a deeper understanding of the world, human behavior, and life. The learning path is structured to accommodate Mike's cognitive profile, which includes strengths in visual information retention and conceptual understanding, with challenges in retaining isolated facts and maintaining focus for extended periods.

The roadmap follows a 25-minute optimal focus period approach with 5-minute breaks, aligning with Mike's attention span. Learning activities are scheduled during peak focus hours (8:00-10:00 and 16:00-18:00) when possible, with review sessions before sleep and in early morning.

## Foundation: Mental Models (Current Focus)

### Phase 1: Core Mental Models (1-2 weeks)
- [x] Systems Thinking
- [x] First Principles Reasoning
- [x] Probabilistic Thinking
- [ ] Map and Territory (understanding that models are not reality)
- [ ] Second-Order Thinking (considering consequences of consequences)
- [ ] Inversion (solving problems backward)

**Application Project:** Create a personal dashboard integrating these models to analyze one significant life decision

### Phase 2: Advanced Mental Models (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Bayesian Updating (formal approach to updating beliefs with evidence)
- [ ] Marginal Analysis (thinking about changes at the margin)
- [ ] Game Theory Basics (understanding strategic interactions)
- [ ] Availability Heuristic (recognizing and countering cognitive biases)
- [ ] Opportunity Costs (understanding trade-offs and hidden costs)
- [ ] Pareto Principle (the 80/20 rule)

**Application Project:** Analyze information sources using mental models to create a personalized information consumption system

## Domain 1: Understanding Human Behavior (1-2 months)

### Phase 1: Basic Psychology
- [ ] Evolutionary Psychology Foundations
- [ ] Cognitive Biases and Decision Making
- [ ] Motivation and Behavior
- [ ] Emotion and Reasoning

**Application Project:** Create a framework for understanding your own behavior patterns

### Phase 2: Applied Human Understanding
- [ ] Communication Principles
- [ ] Relationship Dynamics
- [ ] Group Behavior and Social Influence
- [ ] Cultural Psychology
- [ ] Behavioral Economics Principles

**Application Project:** Design a personal system for improving a key relationship or social interaction

## Domain 2: Natural World Understanding (1-2 months)

### Phase 1: Scientific Foundations
- [ ] Scientific Method and Thinking
- [ ] Energy and Matter Basics
- [ ] Evolution and Complexity
- [ ] Systems in Nature
- [ ] Information and Entropy

**Application Project:** Create a concept map connecting scientific principles to everyday observations

### Phase 2: Applied Scientific Knowledge
- [ ] Earth Systems and Climate
- [ ] Human Biology Essentials
- [ ] Technology and Scientific Principles
- [ ] Resource Cycles and Sustainability
- [ ] Complexity and Emergence in Natural Systems

**Application Project:** Design a personal environmental impact reduction plan based on scientific principles

## Domain 3: Societal Systems (1-2 months)

### Phase 1: How Societies Function
- [ ] Economic Systems Basics
- [ ] Political Structures and Governance
- [ ] Social Institutions and Their Evolution
- [ ] Media and Information Ecosystems
- [ ] Technology's Role in Society

**Application Project:** Map how different societal systems influence your daily life

### Phase 2: Global Perspectives
- [ ] Cultural Value Systems
- [ ] Global Challenges and Cooperation
- [ ] Historical Patterns in Civilizations
- [ ] Future Trends and Possibilities
- [ ] Ethics and Justice Systems

**Application Project:** Develop a personal framework for ethical decision-making

## Integration: Connecting Knowledge Domains (Ongoing)

### Cross-Domain Projects
- [ ] Create a personal "Theory of Everything" connecting key concepts
- [ ] Develop a system for evaluating new information across domains
- [ ] Design a personalized morning reflection ritual integrating multiple domains
- [ ] Build a concept map showing interconnections between all learned areas

## Learning Strategy Implementation

### Active Recall
- Create flashcards for key concepts after each learning session
- Schedule spaced repetition reviews using optimal intervals
- Explain concepts aloud using the Feynman Technique
- Generate and answer questions about material

### Visual Learning Enhancement
- Create concept maps for each major topic
- Use diagrams to represent relationships between ideas
- Translate text-based learning into visual formats
- Sketch processes and systems to reinforce understanding

### Application Focus
- For each concept, identify at least one practical application
- Create small projects that integrate multiple concepts
- Analyze real-world examples using theoretical frameworks
- Connect abstract learning to concrete situations

## Progress Tracking and Reflection

### Weekly Review
- Review learning progress from the week
- Identify connections between different areas of study
- Note areas requiring additional reinforcement
- Update personal context file with new insights

### Monthly Integration
- Create synthesis documents connecting the month's learning
- Revisit and revise earlier concept maps with new knowledge
- Conduct a deeper review of areas that need reinforcement
- Set learning priorities for the coming month

### Quarterly Reflection
- Assess progress toward larger learning goals
- Identify areas needing course correction
- Revise learning roadmap based on discoveries and interests
- Create integration projects that connect multiple domains

## Resources and Tools

### Learning Tools
- Anki for spaced repetition
- Mind mapping software for visual learning
- Pomodoro timer for focus sessions
- Note-taking system for concept connections
- Sleep tracking for optimizing learning consolidation

### Information Sources
- Curated newsletters (instead of constant social media)
- Books focused on foundational concepts
- High-quality online courses
- AI-assisted learning sessions
- Direct application through projects

## Next Actions

1. Complete the remaining Core Mental Models (Phase 1)
2. Set up Anki system for active recall practice
3. Create first integration project connecting mental models
4. Begin systematic improvement of sleep habits using systems thinking
5. Implement information consumption redesign using first principles
