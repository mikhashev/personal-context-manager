# Ethical Principles for Using Personal Context Technology

## Core Principles

1. **User Priority**
   - Technology should serve the user's interests
   - Control over data should remain with the user

2. **Privacy and Security**
   - Information should be stored to minimize risk of leakage
   - Users should have the ability to choose their level of privacy

3. **Transparency**
   - Data processing mechanisms should be transparent and understandable
   - All data changes should be trackable

4. **Accessibility**
   - Technology should be accessible to everyone regardless of socioeconomic status
   - Implementations should strive for inclusivity

## Usage Limitations

This technology **MUST NOT** be used for:

1. **Military applications** of any kind
2. **Manipulation of public opinion**
3. **Mass surveillance**
4. **Discrimination against population groups**
5. **Data collection without explicit consent**

## Implementation Recommendations

When implementing the technology, it is recommended to:

1. **Provide users with choices** of data storage methods
2. **Use encryption** to protect sensitive information
3. **Implement audit mechanisms** for data usage
4. **Minimize data collection** to the necessary minimum
5. **Develop user-friendly interfaces** for managing personal data

Adherence to these principles will ensure ethical use of the technology for the benefit of humanity.
