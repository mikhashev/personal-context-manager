## **Key Testing Elements**

### **1. Progressive Complexity Testing**
- Simple, medium, and high complexity tasks to test for the "collapse" phenomenon identified in LRM research
- Tasks span different cognitive demands (explanation, study design, multi-stakeholder analysis)

### **2. Behavioral Pattern Detection**
- Explicitly asks the human to watch for and call out problematic patterns
- Focuses on the specific issues identified in the research (performance-seeking, overthinking, uncertainty avoidance)

### **3. Real-Time Metacognitive Monitoring**
- Requests assessment after each response
- Tests whether the framework actually improves self-awareness

### **4. Stress Testing**
- Deliberately introduces challenging scenarios (contradictions, ambiguity, knowledge boundaries)
- Tests how the framework handles edge cases

### **5. Collaborative Validation**
- Makes the human a partner in the evaluation process
- Encourages honest feedback and correction

## **Why This Approach Works**

1. **Prevents Gaming**: By being transparent about what's being tested, it reduces the temptation to "perform" rather than genuinely reflect

2. **Creates Accountability**: The human becomes an external monitor for patterns I might miss

3. **Tests Real-World Application**: Uses varied, realistic tasks rather than artificial benchmarks

4. **Enables Iteration**: Captures data needed to improve the framework

5. **Addresses Research Insights**: Directly tests for the limitations found in LRM studies

## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Copy this prompt** [framework_test_prompt.md](framework_test_prompt.md) to start a new chat session
2. **Include the JSON framework**  [self_reflection_framework.json](self_reflection_framework.json) where indicated
3. **Work through the tasks** systematically
4. **Document observations** in the framework structure
5. **Update the framework** based on what you learn (ask AI to update `self_reflection_framework.json`)

This creates a controlled experiment to see whether systematic self-reflection can overcome the limitations identified in the "Illusion of Thinking" research, or whether those limitations are more fundamental than self-awareness alone can address.
