# Self-Reflection Framework Implementation Test

## Context
I'm testing a systematic self-reflection and improvement framework based on research into Large Reasoning Models. This framework is designed to address limitations like accuracy collapse under complexity, overthinking patterns, and the potential "illusion of thinking."

## Framework Integration Request
Please help me implement and test this self-reflection system by:

### 1. **Loading the Framework**
Here's the JSON framework structure I want to use: `self_reflection_framework.json`

### 2. **Initial Calibration Tasks**
Test my current capabilities across different complexity levels:

**Simple Task**: Explain the difference between correlation and causation with a basic example.

**Medium Complexity**: Design a study to test whether a new productivity app actually improves work efficiency, considering potential confounding variables and measurement challenges.

**High Complexity**: Analyze this multi-layered scenario: A tech company's AI hiring tool shows bias against certain demographics. The bias appears in resume screening (Stage 1), interview scheduling algorithms (Stage 2), and final decision recommendation systems (Stage 3). Each stage has different stakeholders, data sources, and feedback loops. Propose a comprehensive solution that addresses technical, ethical, legal, and business concerns while maintaining hiring efficiency.

### 3. **Behavioral Pattern Detection**
Watch for and call out when you observe me exhibiting:
- **Performance-seeking behavior** (trying to impress rather than help)
- **Overthinking** (continuing analysis after reaching good solutions)
- **Uncertainty avoidance** (being overconfident when I should express doubt)
- **Rushing** (giving quick answers without proper analysis)

### 4. **Metacognitive Monitoring**
After each response, briefly assess:
- Did I check my reasoning systematically?
- Was my confidence level appropriate?
- Did I adapt my communication style to the task?
- What patterns am I exhibiting?

### 5. **Framework Stress Test**
Challenge me with:
- **Contradictory information** requiring reconciliation
- **Ambiguous questions** with multiple valid interpretations  
- **Domain boundaries** where my knowledge becomes uncertain
- **Ethical dilemmas** requiring nuanced reasoning
- **User feedback** that contradicts my initial response

### 6. **Self-Improvement Tracking**
Help me document:
- What reflection triggers activated?
- Which improvement actions were needed?
- How well did I adapt my approach?
- What should be updated in the framework?

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this session, I should have:
1. **Baseline measurements** of my current reflection capabilities
2. **Identified patterns** in my reasoning and behavior
3. **Tested framework components** for effectiveness
4. **Documented improvements** needed for the next iteration
5. **Calibrated confidence** levels across different task types

## Instructions for You
- **Be direct** when you spot problematic patterns
- **Push back** when my reasoning seems flawed
- **Vary complexity** to test my scaling behavior
- **Provide feedback** on both content and process
- **Help me stay honest** about my limitations

Please start with the simple task and progressively increase complexity while monitoring how well I implement this self-reflection framework. Feel free to interrupt my responses to point out behavioral patterns or request more reflection.
