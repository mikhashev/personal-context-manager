  This technology solves a fundamental limitation of modern AI systems â€” 
  the lack of long-term memory between sessions. The core principle involves 
  transferring structured data with a mandatory instruction block that defines 
  the rules for processing them, enabling personalized AI interactions while 
  preserving user privacy and control.
