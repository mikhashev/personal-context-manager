# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of the Personal Context Technology, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Using this technology for military applications, mass surveillance, or manipulation of public opinion

## Ethical Use Guidelines

As part of our commitment to responsible technology, we have specific guidelines regarding the use of this technology:

1. **User Control and Autonomy**
   * Users must maintain control over their personal data
   * Systems must be designed to prioritize user agency and informed consent

2. **Transparency**
   * Implementations must be transparent about how data is stored, processed, and used
   * Hidden data collection or processing is strictly prohibited

3. **Inclusion and Access**
   * The technology should be accessible to people of diverse abilities, backgrounds, and resources
   * Contributors should consider accessibility and inclusion in all aspects of development

4. **Prohibited Applications**
   * Military or weapons systems
   * Mass surveillance systems
   * Systems designed to manipulate public opinion or spread misinformation
   * Applications that discriminate against individuals or groups

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html)

## Additional Ethical Considerations

The Personal Context Technology has been designed with human well-being as its primary focus. Beyond the basic code of conduct, we encourage all participants to consider:

1. **Privacy by Design**
   * Always implement the highest standards of privacy protection
   * Consider privacy implications at every stage of development

2. **Fairness and Non-discrimination**
   * Test implementations for potential biases and work to eliminate them
   * Ensure the technology works equally well for all user groups

3. **Environmental Impact**
   * Consider the environmental impact of implementations
   * Optimize for energy efficiency where possible

4. **Long-term Societal Impact**
   * Consider how implementations might affect social dynamics and human relationships
   * Prioritize solutions that enhance human connection and well-being

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold these values and contribute to the development of technology that serves humanity's best interests.

This Code of Conduct combines standard community guidelines with ethical considerations specific to your personal context technology. It establishes clear expectations for community behavior while emphasizing the importance of responsible use, privacy, transparency, and accessibility. The document also explicitly prohibits harmful applications like military use, surveillance, and manipulation, which aligns with your goal of minimizing risks while making the technology openly available.
